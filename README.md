Prework bootcamp study guide
This study guide conveys the differences between the tools of web developers such as HTML, CSS, Git, and Javasript. I set out to complete this guide to learn the basics and build a foundation by not only reading about these tools, but also by utlizing them first hand. This guide holds basic notes of what I learned as well as being a prime example of everything I learned. I learned the importance of debugging, working on different branches, completing pull requests, and the differences between HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
